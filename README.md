# OER-MetadataEditor

The Learning Resource Metadata Editor is **an interactive web page** intended to support **creators of OER** in the set up of appropriate metadata.

The Learning Resource Metadata Editor provides a practical subset of the **LRMI** (Learning Resource Metadata Initiative) standard metadata elements and is simple to use.

The generated metadata block is based on the **schema.org vocabulary** and formulated in **JSON-LD syntax**. The block can be transferred into the corresponding webpage or e-book by copy&paste.

Such metadata can be indexed by web search engines; therefore, finding the resource becomes easier.
